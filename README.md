# Development of Drone for Emergency Services

## Project Overview

This project focuses on developing a drone tailored for emergency services, with the objective of providing real-time situational awareness, reconnaissance, and support in rescue operations, especially in challenging environments like disaster-affected areas.

### Key Features:
- **High-resolution imaging**: Captures detailed data for situational assessments.
- **Real-time communication**: Provides continuous data transmission to emergency control centers.
- **Autonomous Navigation**: Enables geo-fencing and movement through difficult terrains without human intervention.
- **Extended flight time and range**: 40-minute flight time with a 1 km operational range.
- **Environmental durability**: Designed to withstand harsh conditions, improving response efficiency.

## Project Goals

- **Primary Goals**:
    - Implement advanced imaging systems for better situational awareness.
    - Achieve continuous communication through real-time data transmission.
    - Ensure the drone can autonomously navigate predefined geo-fenced areas.
  
- **Additional Goals**:
    - Minimize response time by 50%.
    - Incorporate dual-band communication for reliable transmission in disaster zones.

## Project Timeline

- **September 1 - 15**: Research and system architecture design.
- **September 15 - October 27**: Component selection, prototyping, and integration of communication and imaging systems.
- **October 27 - November 17**: Testing and iterative improvements.
- **November 24 - December 15**: Deployment, validation, and final documentation.
  
## Key Components
- **Drone Controller**: Pixhawk 6C
- **GPS Module**: Neo-6M
- **Sensors**: Ublox GPS, Sharp GP2Y0A21YK0F, HC-SR04 Ultrasonic
- **Communication**: 3DR Radio Telemetry

## Use Cases

1. **Urban Disaster Monitoring**: Flying over collapsed buildings to locate victims.
2. **Wildfire Surveillance**: Mapping fire spread in remote areas.
3. **Hazardous Environment Assessment**: Monitoring chemical spills without risking human lives.

## Testing and Validation

- The drone will be tested under various conditions to validate its navigation capabilities, communication reliability, and environmental resilience.
  
## Conclusion and Future Work

This project provides a robust solution for emergency services by significantly improving situational awareness and response times. Future work could involve expanding the range and introducing additional sensors for more specialized applications, such as wildlife monitoring or infrastructure inspection.
